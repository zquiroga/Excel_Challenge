# Excel_Challenge
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organisations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organise and analyse a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

# Bonus Statistical Analysis

Most people would use the number of campaign backers to assess the success of a crowdfunding campaign. Creating a summary statistics table is one of the most efficient ways that data scientists can characterise quantitative metrics, such as the number of campaign backers.

For an additional challenge, evaluate the number of backers of successful and unsuccessful campaigns by creating your own summary statistics table.
